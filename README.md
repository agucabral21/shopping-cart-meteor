## Meteor Shopping Cart
This is a simple shoppingCart made for a tech evaluation for Talking Points

-   I kept the "imports" directory.
-   Based on the documentation, I added the "server" directory so that some files cannot be accessed from the client side.
-   I created the "productService" and "cartService" modules that implement the business logic, and I use Metheor.methods as controllers that act as orchestrators calling these different services.
